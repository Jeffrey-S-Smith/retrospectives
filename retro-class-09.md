1. What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
  Nothing went well today.

2. What did I learn today?
  I learned about a lot errors and how pain full they can be.

3. What should I do differently next time?
  Maybe take breaks and walk away. Was really frustrated with the errors.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
More about where errors are.

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity
 I almost there to finish lab 8. I have a status code of 500. For my Movies.
