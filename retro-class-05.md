1. What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
  I all went well. Little trouble remembering everything. Lucky I had google. I had trouble with things that would take time and a lot of steps to take care of what I wanted to do.  

2. What did I learn today?
 I learned today to modify someone elses code to my liking.

3. What should I do differently next time?
 Skip the things that I choice to waste my time because it would be a longer process to correct them.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
 Where people put there stuff or short cuts of finding the stuff I am looking for.

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity

Yes I completed it.
