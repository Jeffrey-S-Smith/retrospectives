1. What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
    A lot of information so I took baby steps to get to my goal.

2. What did I learn today?
    I learned to build a server and connect to the front end.

3. What should I do differently next time?
    Maybe try to go little bit faster.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
    Still go through the information from this area.

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity
 No it is not completed I have half of 2 to do and three to do.
