1. What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
  It was hard to stay on track with naming this.prop or this.state

2. What did I learn today?
today I learn to be modal it is very confusing.

3. What should I do differently next time?
  get on with TA more.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
  I need more practice on how to work this with out forgetting things and where things are put.

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity

The protect is not full completed. I need to be able to close the modal.
