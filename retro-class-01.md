1. What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
    Everything went well I had to write down the steps on the command for each project.

2. What did I learn today?
    Today I learned the foreach for code challenge . We learned how to use React and create files and components and using props.

3. What should I do differently next time?
   I should take better notes.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
    I need to learn more about the foreach.

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity

Yes the assignment complete. It took me from 1:30 .pm to 3:00 .pm finish code challenge cause I had a issue with the terminal that I had to deal with so I got on with the TA. Once that was fixed then I could complete. Then it took me from 3:30 .pm to 6:00 .pm to finish lab 01. I is completed.
