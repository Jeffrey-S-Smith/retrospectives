# retro-class-02

1. What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

2. What did I learn today?

3. What should I do differently next time?

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity
