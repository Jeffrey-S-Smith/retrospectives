Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity

No the assignment it not completed I need to finish step four map and adding errors messages.
