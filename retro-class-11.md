1. What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
    It went great had a good partner. Nothing that I had to write down because I took notes today.

2. What did I learn today?
  Learn about mongoose today and to build the database. I thought would be hard but it was pretty easy.

3. What should I do differently next time?
    Nothing

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
    Nothing at the moment.

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity

Yes the project is complete.
